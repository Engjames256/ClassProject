            Hi, I'm Olive. Growing up, I used to love tinkering with things. I thought I would become
            a mechanical engineer so I would tinker with gears and engines. 
        </p>
        <p>
            However, as it often is with life, that didn't happen... Instead, I had an opportunity to explore
            the world of sound for 6 years producing music, commercials,radio promos, features,
            station IDs while writing tons of scripts that had nothing to do with JS.
        </p>
        <p>
            It was such a fun process creating things using sound. 
        </p>
        <p>
            A time came when I had to learn something new, get onto a new career path and here I am -
            tinkering with code, hoping to create great things on this new adventure.
        </p>
        <p>
            Speaking of adventure, scrolling through my gallery slide you can tell I love the outdoors 
            and all sorts of adventures it entails, climbing, hiking, rafting, camping and everything in between.
        </p>
